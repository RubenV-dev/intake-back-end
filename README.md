# README

This repo is the backend for my intake application running on Ruby on Rails (ruby-2.6.1).

This repo contains all the authentication code along with seed data for the intake-front-end repo. 

Once you download the repo please bundle install all the necessary dependencies in order to run the application.

The backend is seeding data using FatSecret Api. Run rails db:seed in order to populate your food search list with foods on the front end.

You can run the server using rails s and then opening http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
